Silent, Automated Keylogger (Educational Purposes Only)
This project demonstrates the creation of a silent, automated keylogger for educational and ethical hacking purposes. The keylogger is designed to capture keystrokes on a Windows system, running undetected in the background without pop-ups or user interruptions. This tool was developed to better understand how malicious keyloggers function and the significant risks they pose to user data and privacy.

Key Features:
Silent Operation: Runs invisibly in the background, making no pop-ups or UI notifications.
Keystroke Logging: Captures all keystrokes (including special characters and key combinations).
Data Logging: Logs captured keystrokes in a text file for analysis.
Automatic Startup: Automatically starts after a 5-minute delay upon boot, ensuring the keylogger runs silently even after a restart.
Purpose:
This project is meant for learning and testing ethical hacking techniques. Understanding keyloggers is critical for cybersecurity professionals, as it helps to identify and prevent these types of attacks in real-world environments.

Important Notice:
This keylogger is intended for ethical use only in a controlled environment or for educational purposes. Do not use this tool for malicious purposes. Unauthorized use of keyloggers is illegal and unethical, and can lead to severe consequences.

Disclaimer:
By using this project, you acknowledge that the creator is not responsible for any damages, legal issues, or consequences arising from its misuse. Always ensure that your cybersecurity practices remain ethical, legal, and within the boundaries of your testing environment.
